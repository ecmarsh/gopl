## Credit

Notes and code examples directly from [_The Go Programming Language_](gopl.io) with some adaptations based on exercises. Highly recommended read from Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan that backs Golang learnings with intermediate computer science topics and general programming best practices, especially with concurrency.
